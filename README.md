# Patient No-Show Prediction

 **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict whether a patient will attend their scheduled medical appointment using a machine learning model.

💻 **Technologies Used**

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)

🔍 **Project Goals**

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
  - Cleaning and preparing the dataset
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
- **Model Selection & Training**
  - Predicting No-Show Appointments
